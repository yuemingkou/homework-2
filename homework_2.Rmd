```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
library(tidyverse)
```

## Problem 1
Read and clean the data
```{r}
subway_data = 
  read_csv("./data/NYC_Transit_Subway_Entrance_And_Exit_Data.csv") %>% 
  janitor::clean_names() %>%
  select(line:entry, vending, ada) %>% 
  mutate(entry = recode(entry, "YES" = TRUE, "NO" = FALSE))
```
The dataset contains line, station name, station latitude and longitude, routes served, entry, vending, entrance type and ADA compliance. My data cleaning steps so far include: load the data and clean up the column names, select columns that I want to keep, and convert the entry variable from character to a logical variable.
The dimension (rows x columns) of the resulting dataset is `r dim(subway_data)`.
These data are not tidy: the route number is spread across 11 columns.
